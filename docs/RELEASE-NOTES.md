# Release notes

Version history of the I&D Quality Demand Planning app, newest first. Every merged change bumps the version in `package.json` and adds its entry here, in the same pull request (CI-09; [CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT.md](CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT.md) §4): **major** for a change that breaks existing data, shared setup files or the way users work; **minor** for a new or changed feature; **patch** for a fix, a dependency update or documentation only. `pnpm test` fails when the newest version here is not the version in `package.json`. CI tags each version `vX.Y.Z` on its merge commit and publishes its GitHub release with the installers and this entry (CI-10); the build number of a version is the CI build of that merge (shown in the app under Force Update, and in `latest.json`). Open bugs and accepted limitations of every version are in [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md); the third-party components of every version are in [SWBOM.md](SWBOM.md).

## v1.4.1 — 2026-11-01

**Changed**
- Pulse Check: the DP **Supported Releases** list under the release quadrants is folded by default, showing only its title and count; **Show list** opens it when needed and the app remembers the choice per viewer (QV-32, TC-QV-17).

## v1.4.0 — 2026-11-01

**Added**
- Automatic tagging: every merge to main that passes the Windows, macOS and end-to-end builds is tagged `vX.Y.Z` by CI and gets its own GitHub release with both installers, their checksums and its entry from these release notes; nobody tags by hand (CI-10, `scripts/release-entry.mjs`).

**Changed**
- CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT.md §2, §4, §5 and §7, README and CLAUDE.md: tagging is done by CI, not after the merge by hand.

**Known issues**
- v1.3.0 (commit `503232d`) has no tag: it was merged before tagging was automatic, and the tag could not be pushed from the development session (LIM-13).

## v1.3.0 — 2026-11-01

**Added**
- Release notes with a version history, and a configuration management plan ([CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT.md](CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT.md)); every merged change now bumps the version and adds its entry here (CI-09).
- The stream mapping set by an admin in the shared setup in Git (DP, CP, IOCC, Content, Tool Validations and DP's data sets) is enforced for every user at their next start; an admin's change is saved to Git on every Save or Set up, with **Save stream mapping to Git** to write it again (CON-79, #178).

**Changed**
- DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md §8 (configuration management) now points to the configuration management plan; CLAUDE.md asks for the version bump and the release-notes entry in every pull request.
