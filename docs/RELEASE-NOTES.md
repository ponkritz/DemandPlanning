# Release notes

Version history of the I&D Quality Demand Planning app, newest first. Every merged change bumps the version in `package.json` and adds its entry here, in the same pull request (CI-09; [CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT.md](CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT.md) §4): **major** for a change that breaks existing data, shared setup files or the way users work; **minor** for a new or changed feature; **patch** for a fix, a dependency update or documentation only. `pnpm test` fails when the newest version here is not the version in `package.json`. CI tags each version `vX.Y.Z` on its merge commit and publishes its GitHub release with the installers and this entry (CI-10); the build number of a version is the CI build of that merge (shown in the app under Force Update, and in `latest.json`). Open bugs and accepted limitations of every version are in [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md); the third-party components of every version are in [SWBOM.md](SWBOM.md).

## v1.4.1 — 2026-11-02

**Added**
- Successor and Predecessor IDs: work items read from Azure DevOps keep the IDs of their Successor and Predecessor links (Dependency link type). A view of its own — a connection that is not a stream or a stream's data set, such as an on-prem release query — shows them as **Successor ID** and **Predecessor ID** columns, sortable, searchable and in the CSV. Stream views are unchanged (CON-81, TC-CON-49).

### Imported upstream v1.5.1 — 2026-11-02

**Fixed**
- New users got the admin's work email pre-filled on their Time Writing connection, and with it the admin's access role and "my" work (KB-19). The work email is now personal: it is never written to the shared connection setup in Git, an email in an older file is ignored, a sync keeps the email entered on the computer, and an email inherited from the file is cleared once so each user enters their own (CON-80, TC-CON-48; DFMEA DF-43; SECURITY-ASSESSMENT SM-22).

### Imported upstream v1.5.0 — 2026-11-02

**Added**
- Create Feature on every stream: the IOCC, Content and Tool Validations release tables now end with the same **QMS-0025 match** column as DP, CP and S&S IT — the matched Feature / User Story, else the closest item and **Create Feature** on every release without a Feature, titled "{stream} | {release name} | v{release}" (QV-46, TC-QV-26). Before, these streams offered it only on releases that were not tracked or matched below the threshold.

**Changed**
- The Time Writing Feature column of those tables keeps its match and hours but no longer has its own Create Feature button (one per release, in the new column).

### Imported upstream v1.4.2 — 2026-11-02

**Changed**
- Daily package update: Electron 44.10.0 → 44.10.1 (desktop runtime, patch release); tslib no longer needed in the lockfile. SWBOM regenerated (CI-08).

**Security**
- `pnpm audit`: 1 moderate finding before and after — GHSA-g3hv-75wg-m249 in the build-time minimatch 3.x, 5.x and 9.x copies of electron-builder, which have no patched release in their lines (accepted, KB-16); not shipped. Secret scan of tracked files and history: clean.

### Earlier v1.4.1 entry — 2026-11-01

**Changed**
- Pulse Check: the DP **Supported Releases** list under the release quadrants is folded by default, showing only its title and count; **Show list** opens it when needed and the app remembers the choice per viewer (QV-32, TC-QV-17).

## v1.4.0 — 2026-11-01

**Added**
- Automatic tagging: every merge to main that passes the Windows, macOS and end-to-end builds is tagged `vX.Y.Z` by CI and gets its own GitHub release with both installers, their checksums and its entry from these release notes; nobody tags by hand (CI-10, `scripts/release-entry.mjs`).

**Changed**
- CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT.md §2, §4, §5 and §7, README and CLAUDE.md: tagging is done by CI, not after the merge by hand.

**Known issues**
- v1.3.0 (commit `503232d`) has no tag: it was merged before tagging was automatic, and the tag could not be pushed from the development session (LIM-13).

## v1.3.0 — 2026-11-01

**Added**
- Release notes with a version history, and a configuration management plan ([CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT.md](CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT.md)); every merged change now bumps the version and adds its entry here (CI-09).
- The stream mapping set by an admin in the shared setup in Git (DP, CP, IOCC, Content, Tool Validations and DP's data sets) is enforced for every user at their next start; an admin's change is saved to Git on every Save or Set up, with **Save stream mapping to Git** to write it again (CON-79, #178).

**Changed**
- DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md §8 (configuration management) now points to the configuration management plan; CLAUDE.md asks for the version bump and the release-notes entry in every pull request.

## Before v1.3.0 — 17 October to 1 November 2026
